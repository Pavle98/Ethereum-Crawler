    <h1>About application</h1>
    <div class="about-text">
      <p>Application is fairly simple, after inputing wallet's address 
        into text field on home page, you will be redirected to that wallet's page </p>
      <p>On that wallets page you can see current balance in ETH and USDT, as well as the value of all ETH coins currently in wallet</p>
      <p>You can also check the amount of ETH and USDT sometime in the past selecting a date and then pressing "Check balance for selected date" button </p>
      <p>Below that, the final perk of this application is searching through transactions, if you want to search inside some block scope </p>
      <p>Just put the numbers in fields, and click on one of four buttons, depending of what transactions you wanna see</p>
      <p>If you want starting block, ending block, or both to be disregarded, just leave them empty</p>
